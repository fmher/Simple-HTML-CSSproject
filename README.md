# Simple-HTML-CSSproject

Project Overview
For my final project, I created a simple, modern website to invite friends to a party using HTML and CSS. The website serves as a more up-to-date alternative to traditional paper invitations, offering a convenient and accessible way to share party details.

Features
The website consists of six pages:

Home Page – The main invitation page.
About Page – Information about the party.
Event Page – Details about the event.
Details Page – Additional information about the party.
Gallery Page – A page for party pictures (currently with a placeholder).
Contact Page – Contact information with external hyperlinks.
Design & Functionality
Navigation Bar: The website includes a navigation bar at the top of every page for easy access to the different sections of the site.
Logo: A consistent logo featuring a cake image is placed at the top left corner of the navigation bar.
Forms: On the Gallery page, I added a form with multiple input fields to interact with users.
Styling: I initially tried to use a single CSS file for all pages, but later decided to give each page its own CSS file for easier customization and better organization.
External Links: I added external hyperlinks to the Contact and Details pages for additional information.
